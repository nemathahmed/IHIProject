## 1st Project Choice
### Topic: Diabetes prediction using Machine Learning
### Project Type: Predefined List
### Problem Summary: 
Diabetes is one of the seventh leading causes of death in the United States. It is also the root cause leading to several other diseases. Thus, early prediction of diabetes can help in preventing further damage and start the required treatment before it's too late. The traditional methods used for diabetes prediction aren’t very accurate and reliable. However, Machine Learning algorithms prove to be well suited for this problem as they can detect patterns in data automatically for accurate predictions, which on the other hand may be too subtle for humans to perceive.
### Proposed Solution:
The solution to the problem of diabetes prediction using machine learning involves training a statistical model on a dataset of patient health records, to accurately predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on certain risk factors. The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or artificial neural networks.
The input features to the model include patient demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and lab results. The model uses these features to make predictions about a person's risk of developing diabetes. The output of the model is a probability score indicating the likelihood of a person having diabetes.
This solution provides a data-driven approach to diabetes prediction, which can help healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions about disease prevention and management. By incorporating a patient's risk factors, the model can provide personalized predictions and recommendations, which can lead to more effective and efficient care.
### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible):
- Lack of high-quality data: The quality and quantity of available data can impact the accuracy of the model.
- Bias in data: The data used for training the model must be diverse and representative of the population to avoid biased predictions.
- Model interpretability: The model's predictions must be interpretable to healthcare professionals and patients so that they can understand how the risk factors contribute to the prediction.




## 2nd Project Choice
### Topic: Stroke prediction using Machine Learning
### Project Type: Predefined List
### Problem Summary: 
Stroke is a clinical condition where the blood supply to the brain reduces or stops, further leading to a reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the brain tissue, thus causing the brain cells to die. According to CDC, “every year 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes”. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Therefore, early prediction of stroke can help in taking precautions beforehand and reducing its severity. Traditional models have several limitations. Therefore, Machine Learning algorithms can be leveraged as a promising tool for stroke prediction.
### Proposed Solution:
The solution for stroke prediction using machine learning involves developing a predictive model that can identify the likelihood of a person suffering a stroke based on certain risk factors. The model is trained using a large dataset of patient health records, which includes demographic information, medical history, lifestyle habits, and lab results.
The machine learning algorithms used in this solution include logistic regression, decision trees, artificial neural networks, or other algorithms suitable for binary classification problems. The input features are fed into the model, which uses them to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke.
The output of the model is a probability score indicating the likelihood of a person suffering a stroke, which can help healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions about disease prevention and management. By incorporating a patient's risk factors, the model can provide personalized predictions and recommendations, which can lead to more effective and efficient care.
In this solution, machine learning techniques offer a data-driven approach to stroke prediction, which can be more accurate and reliable than traditional methods. This can have a significant impact on reducing the incidence of stroke and improving patient outcomes.
### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible):
- Data quality and availability: The quality and quantity of available data can impact the accuracy of the model. This includes the completeness, accuracy, and representativeness of the data.
- Bias in data: The data used for training the model must be diverse and representative of the population to avoid biased predictions.
- Model interpretability: The model's predictions must be interpretable to healthcare professionals and patients so that they can understand how the risk factors contribute to the prediction.
- Ethical considerations: The use of personal health data raises privacy and ethical concerns that must be addressed. There may be legal restrictions on the collection, storage, and use of personal health data.
- Integration into healthcare systems: Integrating the model into existing healthcare systems and ensuring its compatibility with existing processes and technologies is a challenge that must be addressed.





## 3rd Project Choice
### Topic: Intelligent Symptom Checker using Artificial Intelligence
### Project Type: Personally defined 
### Problem Summary:
Despite the advances in healthcare technology, many individuals continue to struggle with access to timely and accurate medical diagnoses. The shortage of doctors in some parts of the world, as well as the cost and inconvenience of medical appointments, can make it difficult for people to receive the medical attention they need.
### Proposed Solution: 
The objective of the intelligent symptom checker is to improve access to healthcare, increase efficiency, and reduce costs associated with medical diagnoses. The tool should provide individuals with a convenient and accessible way to identify potential health issues and take action to address them. It will use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyze a person's symptoms and provide a list of possible medical conditions or diseases that may be causing them. These tools can help individuals quickly identify potential health issues and seek medical attention as needed.
### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible):
- Data accuracy and completeness: The accuracy of the symptom checker depends on the quality and completeness of the medical data that it uses. If the data is outdated or inaccurate, the tool may provide incorrect or irrelevant results.
- Algorithm bias: If the algorithms used in the symptom checker are not properly trained or are biased, the tool may produce results that are not representative of the general population.
- User trust: The success of the symptom checker depends on user trust and adoption. If users do not trust the results provided by the tool, they may not use it or may not take the recommended actions.
- Privacy and security concerns: The use of sensitive medical information in the symptom checker raises privacy and security concerns. The tool must be designed with appropriate security measures to protect user data and ensure that it is not misused or leaked.
- Regulation and compliance: Some various regulations and standards govern the use of medical data and artificial intelligence in healthcare. The symptom checker must be designed and implemented in compliance with these regulations to ensure its effectiveness and success.
- Limited medical knowledge of users: The symptom checker may not be as effective if users do not have a basic understanding of their symptoms or medical conditions. In these cases, the tool may need to provide additional information or guidance to help users interpret the results.
